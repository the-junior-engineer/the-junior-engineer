- 👋 Hi, I’m @the-junior-engineer. I'm a (you guessed it!) a junior software engineer based out of the United Kingdom.
- 👀 I’m interested in stuff like backend development (Python, GoLang), site reliability engineering, taking and giving mock interviews
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GoLang, Kubernetes and general best practices to be a good SWE
- 💞️ I’m looking to build cool stuff with the things I learn. Collaborate with others on projects and generally get better and better everyday
